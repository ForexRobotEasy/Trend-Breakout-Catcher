# Trend Breakout Catcher - ReadMe

## Overview
This code is an example of an MQL5 custom indicator called 'Trend Breakout Catcher'. It is developed by Forex Robot Team and can be used to identify trend breakouts in the forex market. 

## Description
The 'Trend Breakout Catcher' indicator calculates a signal value and a smart line to determine trend breakouts. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to perform trend analysis and breakout prediction. The indicator provides buy and sell signals based on the calculated signal value.

## Input Parameters
- SignalPeriod: The period used for calculating the signal value (default: 14)
- EntryThreshold: The threshold value for entering a trade (default: 0.5)
- ExitThreshold: The threshold value for exiting a trade (default: 0.3)

## Indicator Buffers
- SignalBuffer: Stores the calculated signal values
- SmartLineBuffer: Stores the calculated smart line values
- BuySignalBuffer: Stores the high prices for buy signals
- SellSignalBuffer: Stores the low prices for sell signals

## Initialization
During initialization, the indicator sets up the indicator buffers and defines the plot settings for visual representation on the chart.

## Calculation
The indicator calculates the trend breakout by iterating through the historical price data. For each bar, it calculates the signal value and the smart line value using the provided algorithm. It then stores the calculated values in the respective indicator buffers. If the signal value is above the entry threshold, a buy signal is generated by setting the buy signal buffer to the corresponding high price. If the signal value is below the exit threshold, a sell signal is generated by setting the sell signal buffer to the corresponding low price.
